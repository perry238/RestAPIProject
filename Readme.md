## Code Setup

-> Download the project in your system 
-> open on any IDE
-> Run 'mvn clean install' command to download all the maven dependencies which will be required to run the project
-> And run the dry runner file
    
    As of now Search tag has been written in the file which will run all the test cases required
    
    There is specific tagging done for each test case as well. You can add the tag in the src/main/java/Framework/Dryrunner file and run each tag

-> Loggers have been added at relevant positions to make the person understand as to what is going on inside the project
